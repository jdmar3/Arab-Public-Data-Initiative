<meta name="description" content="This study was conducted at kunduwa forest, Nyala locality, South Darfur State, Sudan, during the year 2017. The main objective of this study was to know the causes and effects of deforestation at kunduwa forest. Primary data were collected by using a questionnaire, meetings and interviews. A questionnaire was distributed to farmers in Kunduwa village and to some refugees in Kalma Camp. Secondary data was obtained from reports, records and related studies. The study showed that education level and environmental awareness is low at the study area, and the income is mainly from agriculture, also the respondents mention that the main causes of deforestation at Kunduwa forest were due to cutting trees for fuel, housing and urbanization, civil war between farmers and pastoralists and the illegal cutting of trees for commercial purposes. The study found that the types of trees found there were Azadirachtaindica, Khayasenegalensis and Eucalyptus micorotheca. These were the most important timber species found at the study area. Leaves, roots and fruits are the main tree parts used in medicine or as fodder and in industry field. Kunduwa forest creates good environment for animals and acts as a source of fodder for them. Also showed that other activities at the study area were farming and grazing, and the main tree species consumed during summer was Acacia mellifera. The study found that the source of income during drought and summer was through grass selling. The study revealed that there were conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Also showed that energy source was from firewood and charcoal. Kunduwa forest was well stocked before refugee's settlement. The study revealed that the forest had been used for recreation. The study also showed that people participation in extension work was low. It also revealed that there was legislation for forest protection though they are suitable for that purpose, but they were not applied effectively. The study recommended that adequate fund should be made available to rehabilitate the destructed forest .Kalma camp of refugees should be shifted far away from the forest. This is in addition to provision of security services so as to implement the extension and plantation programmes.">

The main objective of this study was to know the causes and effects of deforestation at kunduwa forest. Primary data were collected by using a questionnaire, meetings and interviews. A questionnaire was distributed to farmers in Kunduwa village and to some refugees in Kalma Camp. Secondary data was obtained from reports, records and related studies. The study showed that education level and environmental awareness is low at the study area, and the income is mainly from agriculture, also the respondents mention that the main causes of deforestation at Kunduwa forest were due to cutting trees for fuel, housing and urbanization, civil war between farmers and pastoralists and the illegal cutting of trees for commercial purposes. The study found that the types of trees found there were Azadirachtaindica, Khayasenegalensis and Eucalyptus micorotheca. These were the most important timber species found at the study area.
